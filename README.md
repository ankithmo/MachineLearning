# MachineLearning

This repository contains code samples and supporting documentation for the series on machine learning and AI on my blog www.leftasexercise.com. Specifically, you will find the following ressources here.

* An implementation of a **restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)** in the RBM subdirectory, supporing different algorithms (ordinary contrastive divergence and persistent contrastive divergence (PCD)) as well as pure Python executing on a CPU and TensorFlow executing on a GPU (PCD only at the moment)
* A Python implementation of an **Ising model simulation**
* A **Hopfield network** in Python
* various notebooks that I use on my blog for the sake of illustration
* and some addition short samples that I refer to in my blob
* a directory with additonal documentation in LaTex, including material on **Boltzmann machines**, more on **Ising models**, a short introduction to *Markov chains** and **Markov chain Monte Carlo methods** and a short introduction into **statistical physics and thermodynamics**

Of course all these implementations have been created for educational purposes and are not intended for production use - feel free to play with them and modify them if needed. When you use or cite this code or the documentation, please add a reference to this site or my blog www.leftasexercise.com.
